PhD thesis in computational biology.
************************************
This repository is one of the two legacies of my PhD thesis. The PhD thesis has two deliverables that are open to 
the scientific community studying translation by ribosomes. The first deliverable is an instance of an agent-based 
model (ABM) of protein synthesis by a pool of ribosomes acting on a set of transcripts.

To have an overall introduction to the functions and motivations of these simulation tools, the reader is 
invited to read the PhD thesis attached in this repository and entitled 'Protein synthesis by ribosomes, an 
agent-based model of mRNA translation rate incorporating tRNA modifications effects'.

This repository contains all the directories and files that are necessary to conduct protein synthesis simulation by a pool 
of ribosomes on any transcriptome set that you provide as data input.

This instance of the agent-based model is meant to be used on a high performance cluster (HPC) to carry out thousands of
embarassingly parallel simulations. The aim is to conduct parametric simulations and assess the sensitivity and uncertainty
that result from the stochastic behavior of mRNA translation and protein elongation by ribosomes.
MyData directory:
----------------
The directory 'MyData' contains files that are used as input of the program simulating protein synthesis by ribosomes.
transcriptome data:
------------------
The transcriptome data is a fasta file. The file CDSfasta01.txt contains a list of arbitrarily chosen transcripts (mRNA) 
sequences with their metadata. This file is used as input data in the 'Ribosomer' agent-based model to provide the 
codons sequences of each transcript that will be used for the protein synthesis simulations.
