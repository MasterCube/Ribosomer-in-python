MyData directory:
----------------
The directory 'MyData' contains files that are used as input of the program simulating protein synthesis by ribosomes.
transcriptome data:
----------
The transcriptome data is a fasta file. The file CDSfasta01.txt contains a list of arbitrarily chosen transcripts (mRNA) sequences with their metadata.
This file is used as input data in the 'Ribosomer' agent-based model to provide the codons sequences of each transcript that will be used for the protein synthesis simulations
